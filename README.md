## About the project

A simple, professional resume website provided by The Odin Project as part of its Full-Stack JavaScript curriculum. The assignment included designs for mobile, tablet and desktop viewports to follow. I took the opportunity to build the real professional resume of a friend, so I adapt the design to his needs.
